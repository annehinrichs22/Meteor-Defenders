# Meteor-Defenders
Game for OLED 128*64 for Arduino from Adafruit.

This meteor defenders game uses only the basic geometrical shapes from the Adafruit GFX library.

You will have to stay alive as long as you can.

The game uses 4 pushbuttons.

I'm trying to add:

1. A permanently savable highscore.
2. A laser you can shoot with.
3. A way to make it harder.
